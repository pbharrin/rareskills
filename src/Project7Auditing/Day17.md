### RareSkills Riddles: Delete user

This seeminly simple contract starts with 1 Ether and our goal is the steal all of that.  Here is the entirety of the contract: 

```Java
contract DeleteUser {
    struct User {
        address addr;
        uint256 amount;
    }

    User[] private users;

    function deposit() external payable {
        users.push(User({addr: msg.sender, amount: msg.value}));
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 index) external {
        User storage user = users[index];
        require(user.addr == msg.sender);
        uint256 amount = user.amount;

        user = users[users.length - 1];
        users.pop();

        msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    }
}
```
