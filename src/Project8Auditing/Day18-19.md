### RareSkills Riddles: Viceroy

The objective of this is to drain the community wallet of all Ether and transfer that to the attacker wallet.  There are three contracts in the Solidity file.  

1. ```OligarchyNFT``` this is an ERC721 NFT where the constructor mints 1 NFT to the attacker. 
2. ```Governance``` this is the main contract where the Community Wallet gets created, and funded.  Proposals can be created here and voted on.  Each proposal needs 10 votes to be executed.  In order to vote on a prospal a contract can call ```voteOnProposal()``` each address has to be an approved address and can only vote one time.  In order to approve an address a viceroy need to call approveVoter().  Each viceroy can only approve five voters.  Lastly the voter cannot be contracts but only EOAs.  
3. ```CommunityWallet``` when this contract is created the governance address is set.  The governance address can call ```exec(address target, bytes data, uint256 value)``` which will send ether to an another address and perform a function call.   In the ```Governance``` constructor the community wallet owner is assigned to the Governance contract.  

Transfering funds out of the CommunityWallet appears to be possible only by having the Governance contract call ```exec()```, so it appears we need to figure out how to get 10 votes.
